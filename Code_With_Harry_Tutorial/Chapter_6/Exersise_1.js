// Write a JS code to generate a random number and store it in a variable. The program then takes an inpiut from the user to tell them whether 
// the guess was correct, greater or lesser than the original number.
// 100 - (no. of guesses) is the score of the user. The program is expected to be terminated once the number is gussed. Number should be between 1-100
