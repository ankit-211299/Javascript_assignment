    <h3>
      Write a JavaScript program that calculates the grade for a student based
      on their exam score. The program should follow these rules:<br>

      If the exam score is between 90 and 100 (inclusive), the grade is "A."<br>
      If the exam score is between 80 and 89 (inclusive), the grade is "B."<br>
      If the exam score is between 70 and 79 (inclusive), the grade is "C."<br>
      If the exam score is between 60 and 69 (inclusive), the grade is "D."<br>
      If the exam score is below 60, the grade is "F."<br>

      Your program should take the exam score as input and output the corresponding
      grade.<br>
